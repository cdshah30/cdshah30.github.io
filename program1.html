<h4>Benefits of healty Food</h4>
<ul>

<li>
<h3> Makes you Smarter!</h3>

Brain foods are right. Research from the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging shows that putting
 away a lot of saturated and trans fats from fried and processed foods reduces your cognitive 
abilities?and even shrinks your brain?over the years. Meanwhile, high intakes of omega 3's from foods 
like fish, walnuts, and avocados translate into bigger, better functioning brains.
</li>
<li>

<h3> No Stress! </h3>
Foods have a huge influence on your levels of chillaxing neurotransmitters such as serotonin and 
dopamine as well as your levels of stress-inducing hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline.
 For instance, in one 2014 Journal of the American College of Cardiology study, people who ate 
flavonoid-rich dark chocolate before undergoing a mock interview came out on top with lower levels of adrenaline.
</li>
<li>
<h3> Mood And Cognition </h3>
A healthy diet can lead to better overall performance of the mind and body. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, foods high in antioxidants
 can help promote generation of neurons into old age while improving the ability of 
existing brain cells to communicate with each other, resulting in improved cognitive functioning.
</li>
<li>
<h3> Disease Prevention </h3>
A poor diet has been directly linked with diseases such as diabetes, 
heart disease and certain types of cancer. Trans and saturated fats are known to
 cause atherosclerosis, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke. 
Foods high in cholesterol can raise levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol in the blood,
 which also contributes to the arterial damage seen in atherosclerosis.

According to the American Cancer Society, processed meats, fried meats and alcohol
 are associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, such as cancer of 
the colon or liver. Foods that contribute to obesity are also indirectly linked to cancer, 
since obesity increases the overall risk for developing cancer.

What's more, diet may play an important role in mood and mental health.
 According to the American Journal of Psychiatry, a healthy diet is associated with a
 lower incidence of depression, anxiety disorders and dysthymia than a typical "Western" 
diet high in sugar, processed foods and alcohol.

<h3> Energy </h3>
Calories are the unit of measure for stored energy in food. The energy provided by food calories is
 needed for every function of the body, including thought, physical activity, growth and healing. 
According to Medline Plus, foods containing an equal amount of calories and nutrients are ideal for a balanced diet.
Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the building blocks of energy. After ingestion, carbohydrates are broken down
 into glucose, which provides raw energy that is either used immediately or stored in the muscles for later use.
 Complex carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables and fruits provide a balance of calories and nutrients, 
whereas simple carbs such as sugar and white flour are high in calories and low in nutrients, making them a poor choice for energy production.
