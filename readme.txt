* Computer program works with primary webcam attached with PC.

* Computer program was written Visual C++ with OPENCV library version 3

* Program was developed in Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.

* OPENCV Library was integrated with Visual Studio with Ceemple package.

* OPENCV library and program are put in C:/ folder; for multiple reasons.

* Program can be executed on Visual studio 2013 without any error.

* Logic of the program is color based recogition; therefore background color should not be
same as object color.

*Proper lighting environment is very important and it should be made sure that other objects
which has similar color like ball should not be captured with camera.

* Further for high accuracy it is better to use LED ball so all the moves of ball are captured.

*With HD Camera, High performance computer and LED ball its possible to best results. As Ball gets far away from camera; its reduction in brightness makes difficult for camera and program to check its movements.

* Under normal infrastructure of personal computer,attached camera and normal ball; its diffcult to track rapid movements.
